# Numerical_results_TDA
This repository gathers the numerical computations made during the development of the master thesis "The use of Persistent Homology in Data Science for Topological Data Analysis" for the ALGANT Master.

From a data set of accelerations of three different walkers we compute Rips complexes, persistence barcodes, persistence diagrams and different vectorizations, as persistence landscapes and Betti curves.

For the latter, PCA is implemented.

Both, data sets and algorithms used, can be found in:
